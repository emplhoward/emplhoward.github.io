            <h2> Description </h2>
            <p>
            An intelligent system (IS) is a tool that operates in a real world, possesses primary cognitive abilities such as perception, action control, reasoning, or language use, and exhibits intelligent behavior supported by abilities such as rationality, adaptation through learning, or the ability to explain the use of its knowledge by introspection. Currently there is strong industrial demand for people who understand intelligent systems technology and know how to apply it to real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
            Intelligent systems are poised to fill a growing number of roles in today's society, including factory automation, field and service robotics, assistive robotics, military applications, medical care, education, and intelligent transportation. The emergence and continued reliance on the Internet and related technologies has resulted in the generation of large amounts of data that can be made available for analyses. However, humans do not possess the cognitive capabilities to understand such large amounts of data. Machine learning (ML) provides a mechanism for humans to process large amounts of data, gain insights about the behavior of the data, and make more informed decision based on the resulting analysis.
